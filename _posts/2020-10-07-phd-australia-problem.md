- Problem - broken u/grad -> masters -> phd pipeline in Australia. Small number of masters by coursework in technology, APA (whatever called now) only available once in lifetime or once every blah years.
- Problem - mismatch between want industry want in PhD graduates and what academia want in PhD graduates
- Problem - number of academic positions not sufficient for number of PhD graduates
- Result - extreme stress on students, lead to split focus causes poor outcomes
- Solution - extend APA to 4 years, first 12 months is exploratory
