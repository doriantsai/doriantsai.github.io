      title: "Carlie: The Mini-Autonomous Vehicle"
      excerpt: "Carlie is a mini-autonomous vehicle aimed at making research, education and engaging public demonstrations easier. It was developed by a team of engineers at the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV). My role included systems engineering, hardware (mechanical and electrical) design and generation of microcontroller firmware and ROS software. I am a lead engineer on the project and continue to develop the platform and documentation."

      title: "How Automated Vehicles will Interact with Road Infrastructure"
      excerpt: "The project aimed to asses how autonomous vehicles will interact with road infrastructure and the readiness of road infrastructure for autonomous vehicles. My role included management of the data acquistion process as well as the development of software and tools to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of traffic light and sign detection as well as vision and LiDAR-based localisation."

      title: "BBot Kickstarter"
      excerpt: "This Kickstarter project ran in 2016. It was to keep me entertained technically while I read engineering education literature. The aim was to develop an Arduino-based robot that was inexpensive, required no assembly, and could run out-of-the-box with no programming. All you needed to do was flick a switch and could start experimenting with robotics. The project additionally developed several activities that utilised BBot to allow kids to explore the scientific method."
