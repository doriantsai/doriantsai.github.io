My name is Dorian Tsai, a robotics research engineer. Mechatronics and machine learning have revolutionised operations in well-defined environments, but I am excited to use such technologies to explore unstructured outdoor environments. I want to help pioneer this future by developing next-generation autonomous and perception systems and verifying them in realistic environments. I am particularly interested in aspects of robotic vision, light field imaging technology, deep learning and space and field robotics.

Dorian is currently a project specialist in automation prospecting for the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Project (RRAP), as well as a part-time research fellow in an agricultural robotics project at the Queensland Centre for Robotics. In RRAP, he is looking at research and technological interventions aimed at helping to save the Great Barrier Reef from climate change, and identifying automation opportunities that will enable these developments to scale from several local reefs to the entire Great Barrier Reef. In the agricultural robotics project, Dorian is collaborating with academic and industry partners to automatically detect various weed species for precision pasture and vineyard management using state-of-the-art machine vision and deep learning techniques. Dorian completed his PhD at QUT with Peter Corke, Donald Dansereau and Thierry Peynot. Dorian investigated how to develop 4D light field features and how to exploit them for camera motion and vision-based control for robots. He is particularly interested in aspects of robotic vision, perception systems, virtual reality and space systems.

Dorian received his Bachelor’s of Applied Science in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, Canada, and a double Masters of Science in Space Science & Technology from Lulea Technical University in Sweden, and in Robotics & Automation from Aalto University in Finland. He completed his Master’s thesis project at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab on autonomous vision-based tether-assisted rover docking. He then worked as a robotics engineer at the Canadian Space Agency before arriving at QUT for his PhD.
